<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The TechCon conference has been run by different groups during its history. Previously it was organised as part of the UK Radio Festival,<br> under The Radio Academy. Since 2016 it has been run independently by TBC Media Ltd. due to limited resources at The Radio Academy<br>
TBC Media Ltd. is run by Ann Charles and Aradhna Tayal, who are former committee members of TechCon from its Radio Festival days.<br>
TBC Media Ltd. exists to support the UK radio and audio industry by running events to support the technical community, most notably<br>
Radio TechCon.
